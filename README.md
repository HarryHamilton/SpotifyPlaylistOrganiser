Automatic Spotify Playlist Organiser
--------------------------

A WIP program that automatically adds a user’s liked songs on Spotify into the playlists they’re best suited to. It will analyse a user’s existing 
Spotify playlists based on key features such as ‘energy’, ‘danceability’, ‘loudness’and ‘tempo’, then compares this to the songs that need to be categorised. 
Makes use of the Spotify API, Flask and OAuth2
